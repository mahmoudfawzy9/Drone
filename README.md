# Drone
The application is a spring boot application using java 8, open api, sample request, responses for
for a parent drone has medication items using POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE REST API.

Hint: Open your web browser at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html/
then start the journey of regestering a drone.

If you would like to supress warnings during initialization, create 'drone' database and run the sql scripts manually, set the update ddl

Otherwise, to stay consistent with the requirements, I have added an embedded in memory h2 databas config hashed if needed in application.properties : )
